# Rain2Flood
Rain2Flood: From Rainfall to Flood Inundation Mapping in QGIS
This QGIS Toolbox plugin processes rainfall data from IMD or CHIRPS sources to perform hydrological analysis. It calculates design rainfall for various return periods, estimates peak discharge, generates flood inundation maps, and produces hydrographs and HEC-HMS input files.
The Rain to Flood Analysis QGIS plugin enables end-to-end hydrological modeling by transforming rainfall data into flood inundation maps. It supports rainfall frequency analysis, runoff estimation, flood hydrograph generation, and automated outputs compatible with HEC-HMS and QGIS.
Transform rainfall data into flood risk maps with a single workflow üåßÔ∏è‚Üíüåä

Rain2Flood is a powerful QGIS plugin that automates the entire hydrological analysis process - from downloading rainfall data to generating flood inundation maps. Designed for water resource engineers, flood modelers, and disaster management professionals, this tool integrates advanced hydrological methods within QGIS's user-friendly interface.
